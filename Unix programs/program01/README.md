This C program is used to retrieve and print system configuration limits. It utilizes two main functions, `sysconf()` and `pathconf()`, to get various system limits or configurations. Let's break down the code line by line in simple terms:

### 1. #include <stdio.h>
This line includes the **Standard Input Output** library, which provides the `printf()` function used for printing text on the screen.

### 2. #include <unistd.h>
This line includes the **UNIX standard** library, which contains definitions for many system calls like `sysconf()` and constants like `_SC_CLK_TCK`, `_SC_CHILD_MAX`, etc.

### 3. #include <limits.h>
This line includes the **limits** library, which defines constants like `PATH_MAX` or `NAME_MAX` that represent system limits like maximum path length or filename length.

### 4. int main() {
This starts the main function where the program execution begins.

### 5. printf("No. of clock ticks: %ld\n", sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK));

- **`printf()`**: This is used to print a formatted string to the console. `%ld` is a placeholder for a long integer (which is returned by `sysconf()`).
  
- **`sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)`**: `sysconf()` is used to get system configuration values. Here, `_SC_CLK_TCK` is a constant that refers to the number of clock ticks per second, which is useful for timing and scheduling purposes.

- **What it does**: This line prints the number of clock ticks per second, which is a measure of how frequently the system clock "ticks".

### 6. printf("Max. no. of child processes: %ld\n", sysconf(_SC_CHILD_MAX));

- **`sysconf(_SC_CHILD_MAX)`**: This retrieves the maximum number of child processes that can be created by a process on this system. `_SC_CHILD_MAX` is the constant used to refer to this limit.

- **What it does**: This line prints the maximum number of child processes that a process can create.

---

### 7. printf("Max. path length: %ld\n", pathconf("/", _PC_PATH_MAX));

- **`pathconf()`**: This function is used to get configuration limits for a specific file or directory. The first argument (`"/"`) refers to the root directory. `_PC_PATH_MAX` is the constant that refers to the maximum length of a file path.

- **What it does**: This line prints the maximum number of characters that can be used in a file path.

---

### 8. printf("Max. no. of characters in a file name: %ld\n", pathconf("/", _PC_NAME_MAX));

- **`pathconf("/", _PC_NAME_MAX)`**: Similar to the previous use of `pathconf()`, but here `_PC_NAME_MAX` refers to the maximum number of characters that can be used in a file name within the directory `"/"`.

- **What it does**: This line prints the maximum number of characters allowed in a file name.

---

### 9. printf("Max. no. of open files/process: %ld\n", sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX));

- **`sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX)`**: This retrieves the maximum number of files that a process can have open at once. `_SC_OPEN_MAX` is the constant used to refer to this limit.

- **What it does**: This line prints the maximum number of open files that a single process can have.

---

### 10. return 0;
This line ends the `main()` function. `return 0;` indicates that the program has successfully completed its execution.
