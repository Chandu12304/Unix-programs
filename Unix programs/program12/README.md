### Theory Behind Client-Server Communication Using Sockets

To understand the **socket communication** between a server and a client, it’s helpful to break it down into a few fundamental concepts. This example demonstrates how two programs running on the same machine or different machines can send and receive data over the network. Let’s explore this step by step in a beginner-friendly way.

### 1. **What Are Sockets?**

- **Socket**: A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. Think of it like a door on a house that lets data (like people) move in and out. Each computer (or process) has its own door (socket) through which data can be sent or received.
  
  - **Server Socket**: A socket that waits for incoming requests from clients.
  - **Client Socket**: A socket that connects to the server’s socket to communicate.

### 2. **Client-Server Model**

In most networked applications, there are two roles:
- **Server**: The machine that waits for clients to connect to it. It listens for incoming connections and handles requests.
- **Client**: The machine or program that connects to the server, sends requests, and waits for the server’s response.

In the programs we wrote, the server:
1. Listens for connections.
2. Accepts a client’s connection.
3. Receives data from the client.
   
The client:
1. Connects to the server.
2. Sends data to the server.

### 3. **How Communication Works?**

#### Step-by-Step Communication:

**1. Server Setup:**
- The server creates a **socket** that listens on a specific **port**. A port is like an address or a channel through which communication happens.
  - In our case, the server listens on port `8080`.
  
- The server binds its socket to an IP address and port (in this case, any IP address on the machine using `INADDR_ANY` and port `8080`).

- The server then **listens** for incoming connections. It’s like opening a door and waiting for someone to knock.

**2. Client Setup:**
- The client also creates a socket.
- The client then attempts to connect to the server by specifying the **server’s IP address** (`127.0.0.1` means it connects to the same machine) and port (`8080`).
  
- Once connected, the client sends a message (“Hello from client”) to the server.

**3. Server Accepts Connection:**
- The server, upon receiving the connection request, **accepts** it. This is like opening the door to let the client in.

**4. Data Transfer:**
- After the connection is established, the client sends a message, and the server **receives** it. The server prints the received message to the console.

**5. Closing Connection:**
- Both the server and client close their sockets after communication ends, meaning they stop sending and receiving data.

### 4. **Why Do We Use Sockets?**

- **Sockets** provide a flexible way for different programs (even on different computers) to communicate with each other over the network.
- They are the foundation of many internet applications, such as web servers, chat applications, file transfer programs, etc.

---

### 5. **The Key Concepts in the Code:**

- **IP Address**: Every computer on a network has an IP address, which is like its unique identifier. In our example, `127.0.0.1` is the **loopback address**, meaning the client and server are on the same machine.

- **Port Number**: A port is like a door to a computer. Different programs use different ports to communicate. In our case, we used port `8080`.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: This is the protocol used by our sockets. TCP is reliable, meaning it ensures data is delivered in the correct order without errors.

- **Server-Client Communication**:
  - **Server**: Waits for clients to connect.
  - **Client**: Connects to the server and sends data.

### 6. **Real-Life Example**

Think of the server as a **coffee shop**:
- It opens for business (starts listening for clients).
- A customer (client) walks in (connects).
- The customer places an order (sends data).
- The coffee shop serves the customer (receives data and responds).
- After the transaction, the customer leaves (closes the connection).

Here's an explanation of both the simplified **server** and **client** programs:

### **Server Program Explanation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
```
1. **Headers**:
   - `iostream`: Used for printing messages to the console.
   - `cstring`: For handling C-style string manipulation.
   - `unistd.h`: Contains functions for close operations on sockets.
   - `arpa/inet.h`: Includes networking functions such as `socket`, `bind`, `accept`, and `inet_pton`.

```cpp
int main() {
    int serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```
2. **Creating a Socket**:
   - `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)`: Creates a TCP socket.
   - `AF_INET`: This indicates that we are using an IPv4 address.
   - `SOCK_STREAM`: Specifies a TCP connection.
   - `serverSocket`: This variable will hold the file descriptor for the server’s socket.

```cpp
    sockaddr_in serverAddr{};
    serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    serverAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    serverAddr.sin_port = htons(8080);
```
3. **Configuring Server Address**:
   - `sockaddr_in serverAddr`: Structure that holds the server's IP address and port.
   - `sin_family`: Set to `AF_INET` for IPv4.
   - `sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY`: Allows the server to accept connections from any available network interface.
   - `sin_port = htons(8080)`: Sets the port to 8080, and `htons` ensures the byte order is correct.

```cpp
    bind(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr));
```
4. **Binding**:
   - `bind()`: Links the server socket to the specified IP address and port (8080). It makes the socket ready to listen for connections.

```cpp
    listen(serverSocket, 1);
```
5. **Listening for Connections**:
   - `listen()`: Tells the server to start listening for incoming connection requests. The number `1` here means it can queue up to 1 connection at a time.

```cpp
    std::cout << "Waiting for connection..." << std::endl;
```
6. **Console Message**: Informs that the server is now waiting for a client to connect.

```cpp
    int clientSocket = accept(serverSocket, nullptr, nullptr);
```
7. **Accepting a Connection**:
   - `accept()`: This function pauses the server until a client connects. It creates a `clientSocket` for communication with the client. If no client is connected yet, it will wait.

```cpp
    char buffer[1024] = {0};
    recv(clientSocket, buffer, 1024, 0);
```
8. **Receiving Data**:
   - `recv()`: Receives data from the client and stores it in the `buffer`. The size of the buffer is 1024 bytes.

```cpp
    std::cout << "Received: " << buffer << std::endl;
```
9. **Display Received Data**: The message received from the client is printed.

```cpp
    close(clientSocket);
    close(serverSocket);
```
10. **Closing Sockets**:
    - `close(clientSocket)`: Closes the client’s socket.
    - `close(serverSocket)`: Closes the server’s socket.

### **Client Program Explanation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
```
1. **Headers**:
   - Same as the server program, with similar purposes.

```cpp
int main() {
    int clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```
2. **Creating a Socket**:
   - `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)`: Creates a TCP socket for the client. `AF_INET` for IPv4 and `SOCK_STREAM` for a TCP connection.

```cpp
    sockaddr_in serverAddr{};
    serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    serverAddr.sin_port = htons(8080);
    inet_pton(AF_INET, "127.0.0.1", &serverAddr.sin_addr);
```
3. **Configuring Server Address**:
   - `sockaddr_in serverAddr`: Structure that holds the server’s IP address and port.
   - `sin_family`: Set to `AF_INET` for IPv4.
   - `sin_port = htons(8080)`: Sets the port to 8080.
   - `inet_pton(AF_INET, "127.0.0.1", &serverAddr.sin_addr)`: Converts the string representation of the IP address (`"127.0.0.1"`, which is the loopback address) into binary form and stores it in `sin_addr`. This tells the client to connect to the server running on the same machine (localhost).

```cpp
    connect(clientSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr));
```
4. **Connecting to the Server**:
   - `connect()`: The client connects to the server using the server’s address and port. If the connection is successful, communication between the server and client can begin.

```cpp
    const char* message = "Hello from client";
    send(clientSocket, message, strlen(message), 0);
```
5. **Sending Data**:
   - `send()`: Sends the message `"Hello from client"` to the server. The message is sent over the established TCP connection.

```cpp
    close(clientSocket);
```
6. **Closing the Socket**:
   - `close()`: Closes the client’s socket once the message is sent.
