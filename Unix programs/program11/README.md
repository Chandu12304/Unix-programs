### What is a Thread?

- **Thread**: Think of a thread as a lightweight unit of execution within a program. It allows your program to do multiple things at once, called concurrent execution.

### What the Program Does

1. **Creating Threads**: The program creates two threads that run simultaneously. Each thread will execute the same function but will have a different thread ID.

2. **Function of Threads**: The function `countTo100` is executed by both threads. This function counts from 1 to 100 and prints the count with the thread’s ID.

3. **Interleaved Output**: Because both threads run at the same time, their output will be interleaved. For example, you might see a count from Thread 1 followed by a count from Thread 2, and so on. The exact order depends on how the operating system schedules the threads.

### Key Components and Their Roles

1. **`pthread_create`**: This function starts a new thread. It takes four arguments:
   - `&threads[i]`: A reference to a `pthread_t` variable where the thread’s ID will be stored.
   - `nullptr`: Specifies default thread attributes.
   - `countTo100`: The function that the new thread will execute.
   - `&threadIDs[i]`: A pointer to the thread ID that will be passed to the function.

2. **`pthread_join`**: This function waits for a thread to finish. It ensures that the main program doesn’t exit before all threads have completed their work.

3. **`return nullptr`**: Inside `countTo100`, this statement indicates the end of the thread’s execution. `nullptr` is returned to show that the thread function completed successfully.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pthread_t threads[numThreads]`: An array to store thread IDs for the two threads.
   - `int threadIDs[numThreads] = {1, 2}`: An array to store unique IDs for the threads.

2. **Creating Threads**:
   - `pthread_create(&threads[i], nullptr, countTo100, &threadIDs[i])`: This line starts a new thread, executing `countTo100`, and passes the corresponding thread ID.

3. **Waiting for Threads**:
   - `pthread_join(threads[i], nullptr)`: This line waits for each thread to finish before proceeding. It ensures that the main function waits for both threads to complete their execution.

Here’s a detailed explanation of the simplified multithreading program in C++, broken down by each function and keyword:

### Program Breakdown

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <pthread.h>
```
- **`#include <iostream>`**: Includes the standard input-output stream library for handling console input and output.
- **`#include <pthread.h>`**: Includes the POSIX threads library for creating and managing threads.

```cpp
void* countTo100(void* arg) {
    int threadID = *(int*)arg; // Get the thread ID
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Thread " << threadID << ": Count " << i << std::endl;
    }
    return nullptr; // End of thread function
}
```
- **`void* countTo100(void* arg)`**: This is a function that will be executed by each thread.
  - **`void*`**: Indicates that the function returns a pointer to any data type. This is required by the pthread library.
  - **`void* arg`**: A pointer to any data type. It allows passing arguments to the thread function.
  - **`int threadID = *(int*)arg;`**: 
    - **`(int*)arg`**: Casts the `void*` pointer to an `int*` to access the integer value passed.
    - **`*(int*)arg`**: Dereferences the `int*` to get the actual integer value.
  - **`for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)`**: A loop that counts from 1 to 100.
  - **`std::cout << "Thread " << threadID << ": Count " << i << std::endl;`**: Prints the current count and thread ID to the console.
  - **`return nullptr;`**: Ends the thread function and returns `nullptr` to indicate the thread has finished.

```cpp
int main() {
    const int numThreads = 2;
    pthread_t threads[numThreads];
    int threadIDs[numThreads] = {1, 2}; // Thread IDs

    // Create threads
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], nullptr, countTo100, &threadIDs[i]);
    }

    // Wait for threads to finish
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], nullptr);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
- **`int main()`**: The main function where the program starts executing.

  - **`const int numThreads = 2;`**: Defines the number of threads to create, in this case, 2.

  - **`pthread_t threads[numThreads];`**: An array to store thread identifiers. `pthread_t` is the data type used for thread IDs.

  - **`int threadIDs[numThreads] = {1, 2};`**: An array to store unique IDs for each thread. This will help us identify which thread is which.

  - **`for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i)`**: Loop to create threads.

    - **`pthread_create(&threads[i], nullptr, countTo100, &threadIDs[i]);`**:
      - **`pthread_create`**: Function to create a new thread.
      - **`&threads[i]`**: Pointer to store the thread ID.
      - **`nullptr`**: Specifies default thread attributes.
      - **`countTo100`**: The function that the thread will execute.
      - **`&threadIDs[i]`**: Pointer to the thread ID passed to the function.

  - **`for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i)`**: Loop to wait for each thread to finish.

    - **`pthread_join(threads[i], nullptr);`**:
      - **`pthread_join`**: Function to wait for a thread to terminate.
      - **`threads[i]`**: The thread ID to wait for.
      - **`nullptr`**: Specifies no return value from the thread.

  - **`return 0;`**: Indicates successful completion of the program.
